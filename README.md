## About Me

Pursuing my **MS in Data Science at the University of Wisconsin–Madison**, with hands-on production experience across the full GenAI stack — RAG pipelines, LLM fine-tuning, AI agents, and RLHF.

Previously built and shipped real AI systems at **Tata Communications** and **Scale AI's platforms (Outlier & Remotasks)** — processing millions of enterprise records and improving how organizations interact with their data.

I care about building AI that works cleanly in production — not just in notebooks.

---

## Experience Highlights

🏢 **Tata Communications** — Project Trainee, Data Science & AI *(Dec 2024 – Jun 2025)*
Built graph-based RAG pipelines over 500K+ documents, deployed GPT-4 & LLaMA-powered AI agents automating 6 enterprise workflows, processing 2M+ records/month.

🤖 **Scale AI (via Outlier & Remotasks)** — AI Prompt Engineer *(Feb 2024 – Sep 2024)*
Engineered 200+ prompting strategies across 5+ LLM pipelines, applied RLHF to fine-tune multimodal models, curated 10K+ training samples for LLM alignment.

🏢 **Tata Communications** — Project Trainee, Generative AI *(Dec 2023 – Mar 2024)*
Fine-tuned Mistral-7B & LLaMA-2 using LoRA/QLoRA achieving 60% model size reduction, cut inference costs by ~50% through quantization and knowledge distillation.

## 🌱 Currently Learning

The AI space moves fast — here's what I'm actively exploring right now:

- **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** — Anthropic's open standard for connecting AI models to real-world tools and data sources. The infrastructure layer that makes agentic AI actually work at scale.
- **Agentic AI & Multi-Agent Systems** — Building AI that doesn't just respond but reasons, plans, and executes multi-step tasks autonomously using LangGraph and AutoGen.
- **Reasoning Models** — Exploring how models like o1, o3, and DeepSeek-R1 approach complex problem-solving differently from standard LLMs.
- **LLMOps & Production AI** — Monitoring, evaluating, and maintaining LLM systems in production — because shipping is only half the battle.
- **Graph RAG** — Moving beyond flat vector search into graph-based knowledge retrieval for more structured, relationship-aware AI systems.
