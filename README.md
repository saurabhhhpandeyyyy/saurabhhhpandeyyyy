## 💫 About Me

I'm a Data Science grad student at the University of Wisconsin–Madison with hands-on experience building production-grade GenAI systems — RAG pipelines, fine-tuned LLMs, and agentic AI workflows.

Over the past two years I've worked at **Tata Communications** and **Scale AI's platforms (Outlier & Remotasks)**, shipping real systems that processed millions of records and improved how enterprises interact with their data.

Right now I'm deep into **MCP (Model Context Protocol)**, **multi-agent frameworks**, and the latest in agentic AI — because I believe the next big shift in AI isn't just better models, it's smarter systems that can reason, plan, and act.
