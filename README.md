## 👨‍💻 About Me

Pursuing my **MS in Data Science at the University of Wisconsin–Madison**, with hands-on production experience across the full GenAI stack — RAG pipelines, LLM fine-tuning, AI agents, and RLHF.

Previously built and shipped real AI systems at **Tata Communications** and **Scale AI's platforms (Outlier & Remotasks)** — processing millions of enterprise records and improving how organizations interact with their data.

I care about building AI that works cleanly in production — not just in notebooks.

---

## 💼 Experience Highlights

🏢 **Tata Communications** — Project Trainee, Data Science & AI *(Dec 2024 – Jun 2025)*
Built graph-based RAG pipelines over 500K+ documents, deployed GPT-4 & LLaMA-powered AI agents automating 6 enterprise workflows processing 2M+ records/month.

🤖 **Scale AI (via Outlier & Remotasks)** — AI Prompt Engineer *(Feb 2024 – Sep 2024)*
Engineered 200+ prompting strategies across 5+ LLM pipelines, applied RLHF to fine-tune multimodal models, curated 10K+ training samples for LLM alignment.

🏢 **Tata Communications** — Project Trainee, Generative AI *(Dec 2023 – Mar 2024)*
Fine-tuned Mistral-7B & LLaMA-2 using LoRA/QLoRA achieving 60% model size reduction, cut inference costs by ~50% through quantization and knowledge distillation.

## 🌱 Currently Learning

The AI space moves fast — here's what I'm actively diving into:

| Technology | What & Why |
|---|---|
| **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** | Anthropic's open standard for connecting AI to real-world tools — the backbone of production agentic systems |
| **Agentic AI & Multi-Agent Systems** | LangGraph & AutoGen — building AI that reasons, plans, and executes multi-step tasks autonomously |
| **Reasoning Models** | o1, o3, DeepSeek-R1 — how next-gen models approach complex problem-solving differently |
| **LLMOps** | Monitoring, evaluating, and maintaining LLM systems in production at scale |
| **Graph RAG** | Moving beyond flat vector search into graph-based knowledge retrieval |
| **Vision-Language Models** | GPT-4V, LLaVA — multimodal AI systems connecting vision and language |

---

## 🤝 Let's Collaborate On

- 🤖 **Agentic AI systems** — MCP, LangGraph, AutoGen, tool-use pipelines
- 🔍 **Advanced RAG** — Graph RAG, hybrid retrieval, multi-hop reasoning
